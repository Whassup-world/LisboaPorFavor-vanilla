- Once passed → work as freelancer anywhere
- Theoretical classes: past + updated content accessible

- Minimizes MD bloat, reduces scope mixing

### **Decision 2025-11-20: Brand Pack Frozen**
- LBPF_BRAND_PACK.md is canonical brand system
- Portugal/Lisbon colors for topics/tags only
- BRAND STRICT mode enforced

### **Decision 2025-11-20: Bento Template Adopted**
- Guide Bento Template v1 is canonical guide page layout
- Hero Blocks 1-4 + Tile Block 5 structure frozen
- Scalable to all future guides via CMS

## 10. Risk Management

### **Key Risks**
1. **Guide quality:** Mitigated by certification process
2. **Competition:** Mitigated by premium positioning
3. **Scalability:** Mitigated by template system
4. **Technology:** Mitigated by simple, maintainable stack
5. **Market demand:** Mitigated by MVP testing

### **Contingency Plans**
- If guide demand low: Focus on agency partnerships
- If traveler demand low: Increase marketing spend
- If technology fails: Fallback to manual processes
- If competition intensifies: Double down on quality/training
