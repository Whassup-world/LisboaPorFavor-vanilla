## 10. Risk Management

### **Key Risks**
1. **Guide quality:** Mitigated by certification process
2. **Competition:** Mitigated by premium positioning
3. **Scalability:** Mitigated by template system
4. **Technology:** Mitigated by simple, maintainable stack
5. **Market demand:** Mitigated by MVP testing

### **Contingency Plans**
