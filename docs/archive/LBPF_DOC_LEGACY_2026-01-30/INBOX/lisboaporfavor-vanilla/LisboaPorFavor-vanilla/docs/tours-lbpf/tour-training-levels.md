# Tour Guide Training – Lisbon - Alfama Vintage Market Walking Tour With Tastings & Belém Bike Tour

Internal training outline for the two flagship LBPF tours in the vanilla project:

- Lisbon - Alfama Vintage Market Walking Tour With Tastings
- Lisbon Bike Tour to Belém

This document focuses on what guides need to know (theoretical training) and how they should be evaluated in practice.

## 1. Training philosophy

- Guides are storytellers, safety managers and local hosts at the same time.
- Training is split into **three levels**: Beginner, Advanced and Expert.
- Each level covers **theory**, **practice** and **evaluation**.

## 2. Levels overview

### 2.1 Beginner level – "Can assist"

**Goal:** Trainee can assist on tours, but does not lead a group alone.

**Theory modules (shared for both tours):**

- LBPF vision and brand basics: what makes our tours different.
- Short history of Lisbon (timeline, 1755 earthquake, key neighbourhoods).
- Service basics: greeting guests, checking bookings, timekeeping.
- Safety basics: moving with a group, crossing streets, emergency contacts.

**Alfama-specific theory:**

- Graça and Alfama overview: hills, miradouros, churches, markets.
- Basics of Portuguese food: petiscos, pastel de nata, tavern culture.
- Key stops: Miradouro da Graça, Tabernita, Cervejaria Amigo António, Manteigaria.

**Belém bike-specific theory:**

- Route overview: from city centre to Belém, downhill and flat sections.
- Bike safety basics: helmets, braking, gears, hand signals, formation.
- Main landmarks: riverfront, bridge view, Belém monuments.

**Output / exam:**

- Written or online quiz (20–30 questions) covering shared and tour-specific basics.
- Short spoken introduction (2–3 minutes) to each tour in front of a trainer.

### 2.2 Advanced level – "Can lead standard groups"

**Goal:** Guide can lead regular paying groups for either tour independently.

**Theory modules (shared):**

- Storytelling tools: hooks, building arcs, using questions.
- Reading the group: energy, attention span, cultural sensitivity.
- Handling problems: late guests, no-shows, weather changes, overcrowded stops.
- Upselling in a soft way: recommending other LBPF tours and partners.

**Alfama-specific theory:**

- Deeper stories for key places: Graça, Alfama lanes, markets, taverns.
- Food depth: ingredients, regional differences, wine basics, common allergies.
- Alternative routes for rain, heat and major events.

**Belém bike-specific theory:**

- Deeper history around maritime discoveries and empire (high-level, non-political).
- Group riding scenarios: mixed ability groups, nervous riders, kids with adults.
- Alternative safe routes for strong wind, rain or events on the riverfront.

**Output / exam:**

- Guide prepares a **full stop-by-stop script** for one tour, with plan B/C options.
- 15–20 minute mock segment delivered live, including one “difficult guest” scenario.

### 2.3 Expert level – "Can train others & handle special groups"

**Goal:** Senior guide can mentor juniors, lead complex groups and contribute to new tour designs.

**Theory modules (shared):**

- Coaching skills: giving feedback, running debriefs, setting improvement goals.
- Working with special groups: corporate events, schools, press and influencers.
- Designing new tour angles (for example: specialised food themes or focus topics).

**Alfama-specific theory:**

- Deeper cultural, social and architectural context of the neighbourhood.
- Ethical storytelling: sensitive topics, local residents, gentrification.

**Belém bike-specific theory:**

- Advanced risk assessment: traffic changes, large events, group size > 12.
- Logistics for longer or custom routes (combining Belém with other areas).

**Output / exam:**

- Design of a themed variation of one existing tour (outline + learning goals).
- One real tour observed by a trainer, with written evaluation.

## 3. Practical training – Lisbon - Alfama Vintage Market Walking Tour With Tastings

### 3.1 Steps

1. **Route walk-through with trainer**  
   Walk the full itinerary, note timings, bottlenecks, toilets and backup options.

2. **Shadowing**  
   Trainee joins 1–2 real tours as silent observer, taking notes on timing, guest flow and stories.

3. **Co-guiding**  
   Trainee delivers the intro and selected stops (for example Miradouro da Graça and one food stop), while trainer covers the rest.

4. **Full mock tour**  
   Trainee leads a simulated tour with 4–6 test guests; trainer observes.

### 3.2 Evaluation checklist (Alfama)

- Timekeeping between viewpoints and food stops.
- Clarity and volume of voice in outdoor and indoor spaces.
- Accuracy and balance of history, culture and food explanations.
- Group safety in narrow streets and crossings.
- Coordination with venues (arrival times, space, dietary notes).
- Closing the tour with clear next-steps and recommendations.

## 4. Practical training – Belém Bike Tour

### 4.1 Steps

1. **Technical skills session**  
   In a safe open area: braking, gear use, slow-speed control, hand signals and emergency stopping.

2. **Route dry run without guests**  
   Trainer and trainee ride the full route together, focusing on junctions, crossings and tricky sections.

3. **Content run with small group**  
   Trainee leads with 2–4 test guests or staff, delivering basic stories at main stops while managing formation.

4. **First real group under supervision**  
   Trainee leads a paying group while trainer rides at the back or side.

### 4.2 Evaluation checklist (Belém)

- Safe control of speed and formation on downhill and flat segments.
- Clear and consistent use of hand signals and verbal instructions.
- Choice of safe places to stop and talk.
- Ability to adjust pace for stronger and weaker riders.
- Handling minor mechanical issues (chain off, saddle height, etc.).
- Keeping group together and calm in traffic or crowded areas.

## 5. Certification and follow-up

- **Beginner:** passed theory quiz + shadowed at least one tour.
- **Advanced:** passed mock tour and real tour observation.
- **Expert:** demonstrated ability to train others and design a variation.

Re-certification and continuous training can be added later once the academy structure is live.
